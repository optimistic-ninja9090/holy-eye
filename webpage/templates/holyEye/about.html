<head><title>About Us</title></head>
We made something that you get in nmap but this is web-based so you don't have to install nmap <br>
We provide same/more options than nmap <br>
You don't have to type the whole thing(as in the command) just select the type of scan you want to do and our script does it for you!! <br>
